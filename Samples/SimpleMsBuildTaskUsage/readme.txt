This sample demonstrates how to use the CCCP MSBuild task in the simplest way possible inside a MSBuild file.

* No dependencies on the .targets file
* All assemblies local to the directory
* No .csproj necessary


NOTE PRIOR TO BUILDING 

You have to copy

ICSharpCode.CCCPLib.dll
ICSharpCode.NRefactory.dll
ICSharpCode.SharpDevelop.Dom.dll

to this folder.
